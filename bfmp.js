            <div class="section">
                <h3>1.1 Background and Scope</h3>
                <p>Biofouling represents a significant vector for the transfer of invasive aquatic species. If not managed appropriately, biofouling on vessels has the potential to result in the establishment of invasive aquatic species which may pose threats to human, animal and plant life, economic and cultural activities, and the aquatic environment. Biofouling can also impose operational limitations and additional costs for vessel maintenance and operations.</p>
                <p>This Biofouling Management Plan has been developed to comply with the International Maritime Organization's Guidelines for the Control and Management of Ships' Biofouling to Minimise the Transfer of Invasive Aquatic Species (IMO Resolution MEPC.207(62)), Australian national guidelines based on the Biosecurity Act 2015, and other applicable international and national regulations.</p>
                <p>Biofouling is the accumulation of aquatic organisms such as microorganisms, plants, algae, and animals on surfaces and structures immersed in or exposed to the aquatic environment. Implementation of an effective biofouling management regime is critical for minimising the transfer of invasive aquatic species and reducing operational costs associated with increased hull resistance.</p>
                
                <h3>1.2 Vessel Applicability</h3>
                <p>This Biofouling Management Plan is specific and unique to the vessel ${getFieldValueOrPlaceholder(data.vessel.name, 'Vessel name must be entered in the Vessel Details section')}, IMO ${getFieldValueOrPlaceholder(data.vessel.imo, 'IMO number must be entered in the Vessel Details section')}, and has been prepared in accordance with IMO Resolution MEPC.207(62).</p>
                <p>This Plan is to be used in conjunction with the vessel's Biofouling Record Book, which documents all inspections and biofouling management measures undertaken on the vessel.</p>
                
                <h3>1.3 Safety and Training Considerations</h3>
                <p><strong>Safety Procedures:</strong> The vessel's safety procedures must be followed for all inspection and cleaning work, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lockout/tagout of propulsion shafts, rudders, thrusters, trim tabs, and other rotating or moving equipment</li>
                    <li>Confined space entry procedures in accordance with vessel procedures and applicable regulations</li>
                    <li>Diving operations safety protocols for underwater inspection and cleaning activities</li>
                    <li>All relevant tag-out and permit-to-work procedures as specified in vessel standing orders</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Personnel Qualifications:</strong> All personnel involved with in-water inspection and cleaning of biofouling must be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suitably qualified for underwater tasks or confined space entry as applicable</li>
                    <li>Trained in identifying biofouling and assessing biofouling levels</li>
                    <li>Familiar with this Biofouling Management Plan and associated procedures</li>
                    <li>Aware of biosecurity requirements and invasive species risks</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> In-water hull cleaning should only be conducted following approval from the port authority or other applicable regulatory authority, consistent with local and national in-water cleaning guidelines. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) must be obtained and held with the Biofouling Record Book for all chemicals used for cleaning or treatment of biofouling.</p>
                
                <h3>1.4 Plan Structure</h3>
                <p>This Biofouling Management Plan details:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vessel particulars and operational profile</li>
                    <li>Description of hull and niche areas where biofouling is likely to accumulate</li>
